# web-crawler-practise
  This crawler will get the first link in the main text of a Wiki page and then repeating the process for subsequent pages.When it form a loop, the program will terminate and print the path. This project is inspired by article: Wikipedia:Getting_to_Philosophy. However, different from the article, most pages I try will end in "Language".
